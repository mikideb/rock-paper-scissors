# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction

This project was made with sketches by the frontendmentor.io website.
The application is based on the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors". The user will pick his choice on the first screen, and in order to move forward through the steps of the game the user will keep clicking on his choice until the final result.
The user score is saved in the local storage of the browser.

The technologies I implemented in this project: React, JSX, CSS Grid/Flexbox and Reach Router.
